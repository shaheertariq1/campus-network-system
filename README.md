# Network Setup Project

## Overview
This project consists of setting up a network infrastructure across 4 labs, distributed in 2 buildings. Each building contains 2 labs. The network design ensures efficient connectivity, enhanced performance, and centralized control.

## Infrastructure

1. **Buildings and Labs**:
    - There are 2 buildings.
    - Each building consists of 2 labs, making a total of 4 labs.

2. **Network Devices**:
    - **Wired Routers**: Placed in each building to facilitate wired connectivity.
    - **Wireless Routers**: Used to handle mobile phones and other wireless devices, ensuring seamless connectivity throughout the buildings.

3. **Cooling System**:
    - Fans are attached in each building to maintain optimal operating conditions for network devices.

4. **Control**:
    - The control of each building's network is given to the assistant of the respective lab.

## Network Configuration

1. **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)**:
    - The network in each lab is created through VLANs to segment the network, improve security, and enhance performance.

2. **VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol)**:
    - VTP is used to set up connections between the 2 labs in each building, ensuring efficient VLAN management and configuration consistency.

3. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:
    - IP addresses are assigned through DHCP, eliminating the need for manual static IP address configuration. This simplifies network management and reduces configuration errors.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Performance**: The use of VLANs and VTP helps in optimizing network traffic and reducing congestion.
- **Seamless Connectivity**: Wireless routers provide robust connectivity for mobile devices and other wireless equipment.
- **Efficient Management**: DHCP simplifies IP address management, while VLANs and VTP ensure efficient network configuration and segmentation.
- **Centralized Control**: Each lab assistant has control over their respective building's network, enabling effective local management and quick response to any issues.

## Summary

This network setup project ensures a high-performance, secure, and efficiently managed network infrastructure across 4 labs in 2 buildings. The combination of VLANs, VTP, DHCP, and wireless routers provides a robust solution for both wired and wireless connectivity needs. The project setup supports enhanced network management, security, and performance.
